#  Core Skills - Geoscientist to Data Scientist 12 week program

Welcome to the Geoscientist to Data Scientist 12 week program! This repo contains all the course content for the next 12 weeks.

**Getting help:** we'll have a Gittr chat room set up for the duration of the course where you can get help from course facilitators and other course participants. You can sign up with your Github account here:

## How to find your way around

Each week has its own folder. Inside the folder are several different files and subfolders:

- **README.md** - do as it says! We'll put important information, suggested reading and other special bits and bobs for the week in here. We'll also provide the relevant Binder links for running the code in a cloud environment here.

- **environment.yml** - this contains the Python dependencies required to run the jupyter notebooks and code examples

- **data** - contains the data for the week, feel free to have a poke around. Note that some data sources we use may be live databases online - we'll try and provide you with instructions for setting these up for yourself where we use these.

- **\*.ipynb** - these are the Jupyter notebooks with the code examples. If you click these on Github they will get rendered nicely to HTML. But if you want to run the code you will need to either do so in Binder or locally on your machine.

## Getting set up locally

We recommend that you get these code examples running locally - we'll provide online environments for those that can't install things on their work machines but make no claims as to the security or safety of using these environments. In particular saving your work will be easier. 

### Getting set up for the course (do this once)

There are two prerequisites for getting this running - you will need both Git (a software collaboration/versioning tool) and a Python installation. There will be a prerequisite two-day course (run by the Curtin Uni Data Carpentery team) to introduce you to these tools and get you up and running, but if you're keen to get started we recommend:

- [**GitKraken**](https://www.gitkraken.com) for managing Git repositories - this is a nice cross-platform GUI which removes some of the confusion of the commandline. It's free for non-commercial use and pretty cheap for commercial licenses. There are other git clients out there but this is the easiest we've found so far. They also have a good [getting started guide](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/guide). [Get it here](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)
- [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/) for managing Python and R dependencies - we will be managing several Python environments over the course of the program and conda provides a way of doing this easily. [Get it for your platform here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

Once you've got these tools you can 

You will need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your own github account to be able to push changes into it. All you need to do is click the **Fork** button (see below) and you've got your own copy. ![fork button	https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

Then you need to [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your local machine. If you're using GitKraken, you can sign in with your Github account to make this easier, [following these instructions](). Make sure that you pick your personal repository so you can push changes back to it (participants have read-only access to the main core-skills repository).
